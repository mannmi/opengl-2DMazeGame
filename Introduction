This is a dynamic Maze Game. At the moment there are still some issues with the collision detection. And the Objective has yet to be implemented properly.

Short explanation To Somme of the implementation:

Map generation: The map is generated using an array of type Cell (struct).
This enables the map to be dynamically generated (if the map data is generated using a maze algorithm) Door=false means that there is no generated block placed to the location.

The walls are generated using 2 triangles which are rotated and moved in the correct locations in the function initVectormap() this function writes to the mapVericies.

Character:
The character is initialized using initVectorChar() the Character gets moved using the glfwSetKeyCallback registered keyinputs.

The Character gets the current location in relation to the Grid using getConntext(). This is also
intended to be used for collision detection as this makes it possible to only calculate the collision for
the current Cell.

This Project was Based on The THU 2022 model code example snippets as well as the Profersors Github repository.
